<p>DataDrawer is a prototype for dynamic drawings. The term dynamic drawing comes from <a href="https://vimeo.com/66085662">this talk</a> by Bret Victor and the idea is to provide a tool that mixes the flexibility and directness of a drawing tool, e.g., Adobe Illustrator, with the repeatability of a programming language, e.g., <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3 js</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="why-was-this-built" class="anchor" href="#why-was-this-built" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why was this built?</h3>

<p>The primary purpose is to explore the ideas around more direct programming interfaces for infographics. We waited around a bit to see if a tool would come out that implemented the ideas of the talk and didn't see it so we built it. We also put some effort into making it as light weight as possible with regards to sharing and forking drawings and a model like (jsbin)[<a href="https://jsbin.com/">https://jsbin.com/</a>] seemed the best to us.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, one other reason we built this was to explore what types of architectures could best support building a tool like this. We actually scrapped the very first attempt at this tool because the code got complicated pretty fast. The basic idea of this tool is simple enough, but getting a lot of the details right and the edge cases required some thought and elbow grease to make sure the code didn't come out a complete non-performant mess. The current architecture takes advantage of React and Immutable to address these goals.</p>

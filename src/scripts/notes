New features under this architecture:
- from point on rect (other shapes?) will be able to take expressions
- to point can take expressions

DrawInstructions:
- can be either from/to or from/size
- in general they are not in a canonical form
=>
JS that generates shapes
This is needed because instructions can contain expressions
=>
- Shape has canonical form
- must be able to to calculate measurements in canonical form for each shape
from the instruction

Needed for compilation:
- get shape refered to in to/from points
- get point from shape referred to to/from points
- get x,y of a point
- ability to determine whether to use width/height/size vs to-point
